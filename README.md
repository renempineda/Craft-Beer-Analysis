# Using Data Science to study craft beers and breweries

## This repository will contain the datasets, documentation and analysis produced by Chaoshun Hu, Mahesh Kuklani and Rene Pineda, to be presented to the Brewers Association, in Boulder, CO

## Purpose of the project
Economic and market data indicates that the Craft Beer market has experienced a surge in the last two decades. The number of small independent breweries and types of beers produced has exploded. The purpose of this project is to use industry data to gain a better understanding of the market, the producers, the characteristics of its products, and derive insights that can be useful for the industry to grow.

## Analysis

The analysis will answer the following questions:

1. How many breweries are present in each state?
2. Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.
3. Report the number of NA's in each column.
4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
6. Summary statistics for the ABV variable.
7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.
